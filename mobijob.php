<!--<h5><b>The ACM SIGMOBILE Student Career Evening</b></h5>
<p>MobiCom 2019 is proud to host the fourth edition of ACM SIGMOBILE Student Career Evening (MobiJob). This event seeks to bring together top companies in the field with the best and brightest students and postdocs from the ACM SIGMOBILE community. MobiJob aims to assist with both full-time positions, as well as internships.</p>

<h5><b>Event Location and Time</b></h5>
<b>Event timing:</b> Wednesday, October 23, 5 p.m.<br/>
<b>Event location:</b> TBD
<br/><br/>

<h5><b>Student and Postdoc Participation</b></h5>
<p>Interested students and postdocs should indicate their interest when registering for the MobiCom conference. Due to space limitations, student attendance might be restricted and allocated on a first come first served basis. We suggest that student and postdoc participants bring copies of their CVs that indicate interest in full-time or internship positions.</p>

<p>Note that MobiJob is free for all student/postdoc attendees of MobiCom.</p>

<h5><b>Industry Participation</b></h5>
<p>Companies wishing to participate in MobiJob are requested to contact the event chair, Aaron Schulman (contact information below). All MobiCom 2019 sponsors are warmly invited to participate, and can do so at no additional cost. Other companies are also welcome but will need to pay an event registration fee. (Company representatives who attend MobiCom can pay this fee during registration by selecting the MobiJob event. Companies who will only be attending the MobiJob event should contact the event chair for information on how to pay the event fee.) All companies will be provided a 3-minute opportunity to introduce themselves to students and postdocs at the event. Company representatives will also be able to mingle with students and postdocs during the event.</p>

<h5><b>Participating Institutions</b></h5>
