<p>From The Office website: "Once upon a time in the decade of the 70’s, when our peninsula was a remote and isolated place and a few visitors came to the region, the first —and at that time the only— palapa on the beach was built on the Médano Beach of Cabo San Lucas.</p>

<p>On the virgin beach this palapa with its small kitchen and unpretentious bar, tended to the needs of locals and the few tourists we then had, offering simple fare such as ceviche, fried fish, burritos or hamburgers and the always wanted margaritas, cuba libres and beers besides the traditional water or coffee.</p>

<p>A local character, a gringo viejo —as the writer Carlos Fuentes would say— rented wind surf equipment on the beach and entertained his clients and friends in this same palapa, which was referred by him and others as "the office". The name stuck, and shortly after a blue sign with yellow lettering popped up identifying the place officially as an office… The Office on the Beach."</p>

<h5><b>History and Culture of Los Cabos</b></h5>

<p>Approximately 14,000 years ago, nomadic tribes arrived to what is now the peninsula of Baja California. The three largest populations in the peninsula, prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, were the Pericu, Guaicura, and Cochimi. The Pericu inhabited the southern tip of the peninsula, including current day Cabo San Lucas which as then named Yenecamu (“the place where two waters meet”). </p>

<p>The founding of Cabo San Lucas is generally credited to a time in the late 1700’s when Cipriano Ceseña, his wife Luciana, and their 13 children first settled near El Medano beach. Since then, Cabo has grown and become one of Mexico’s top tourist destinations. Fun fact: part of the early history of Cabo is known thanks to the a book by the japanese authors Maekawa Bunzo and Sakai Junzo</p>

<p>In the mid 1970’s Mexico’s government begun developing the southern tip of Baja California into a tourist destination. Since then, Cabo’s population has grown steadily along with the infrastructure, tourist attractions, hotels, and has helped the state’s economy diversify away from salt mining and agriculture industries, into tourism and eco-tourism.</p>
