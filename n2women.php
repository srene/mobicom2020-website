<!--<h5><b>N2Women Event Overview</b></h5>-->
<p>The N2Women workshop aims to foster connections among the under-represented women in computer networking and related research fields. Its goal is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect newer generations of networking women researchers with the community and create mentorship relationships;</li>
  <li>Create a research forum in which students and junior researchers learn and discuss current trends in networking, present their research and receive feedback;</li>
  <li>Engage a diverse body of junior researchers in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome here <b>everyone</b> who share the same research interests, attend the same events, and often face the same career hurdles and obstacles to joining us on Monday 21 September at 11:30am PST (7:30pm BST / 8:30pm CET) for our N2Women event co-located with Mobicom 2020!</p>
<p>This year’s program will feature enlightening talks from women experts in mobile and wireless communications, as well as a live panel engaging both on technical challenges and soft skill assets in a de-facto online world.</p>
<p>An associated Slack channel will also be available for live discussions throughout the Mobicom conference. Please stay tuned for details.</p>

<h5><b><a name="yr">N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship Awards</a></b></h5>
<b>Fellowship Overview and Application Instructions</b><br/>
<p>N2Women is pleased to announce the continuation of our N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship awards. N2Women considers you a young researcher if you are currently a student, working as a post-doc, or in the 1st or 2nd year of your new research career. These awards will partially cover a young researcher’s travel cost (up to $1000) to a meeting where an N2Women event will be held.</p>

<p>In exchange, the young researcher must help organize the N2Women meeting and attend the event. The MobiCom'19 N2Women event will be a dinner, which will be held in the evening of October 22. The benefit of doing the organization, in addition to the travel funds, is for the young researcher to connect with the organizers of the conference who are, typically, leaders in the research field. We will arrange for a faculty or research member of N2Women to assist/mentor the young researcher in this task.</p>

<p>Support for these N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship awards has been generously provided by ACM SIGMOBILE.</p>

<p>To apply for this fellowship or for more information, please see: <a href="http://n2women.comsoc.org/ ">http://n2women.comsoc.org/</a> and click the Fellowships link.</p>

<p>The deadline for applications for ACM MobiCom 2019 is July 20.</p>
