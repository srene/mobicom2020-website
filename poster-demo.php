The ACM MobiCom 2020 demo session solicits the submission of research, platform, and product demonstrations, and exhibits from both academia and industry.

Demonstrations should showcase innovative research or product prototypes, platforms, and applications in the areas of mobile computing and wireless and mobile networking. We strongly encourage demos based on novel applications in the domain of mobile computing and wireless systems. We also welcome live​ demos reproducing evaluation results of papers appearing in ACM Mobicom 2020 or past editions as well as other relevant venues. Please refer to the main conference introduction and CFP for the general areas that are relevant to the typical MobiCom audience.

The MobiCom 2020 Demo committee will review all submissions to select the accepted demos. <br/><br/>
