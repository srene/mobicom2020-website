<h5><b>Hotel: Paradisus Los Cabos</b></h5>
<p>Paradisus Los Cabos is an all-inclusive luxury resort that is consistently rated among the top hotels in the world. See <a href="registration.php">Registration and Hotel Reservations</a> for instructions to reserve a room at a significantly discounted rate. We highly encourage you to stay at the conference hotel for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The committee has secured exclusive room rates for conference attendees. These rates are significantly lower than standard rates. The rates are much lower, in part, because your conference registration will cover all food and beverages during the conference at this all inclusive resort. There are 7-8 restaurants and bars on the property. Eat as much as you want, drink as much as you want - it is all included. This resort is rated highly for the quality and variety of the food.</li>
<li> Other hotels that are within a reasonable commute of the conference will be significantly more expensive, and in many cases, not as nice. Most hotels are not on the beach. Paradisus is.</li>
<li>There will be conference technical and social activities that run well into the night and travel to/from a remote hotel late at night and early in the morning can be challenging to say the least.</li>
<li>Staying at the conference hotel significantly helps the conference and SIGMOBILE financially. The conference committed to a fairly large room block and is required to pay the hotel for any unused rooms.</li>
</ol>

<h5><b>Hotel Pricing</b></h5>
<p>The hotel room rate at the Paradisus will include a $145 rebate from ACM on any night where at least one person in the room is registered for the main conference or a workshop on the following day. <b>To book your discounted room, see Registration and Hotel Reservations. You will not receive the discount if you book directly.</b> We have also negotiated lower rates on other nights. Rooms include unlimited food, beverages, and access to the resort from 4pm on each day of your reservation to 4pm the following day.</p>

<p><b>The hotel reservations link will give you the $145 rebate from ACM on all nights of Oct 20 through Oct 24. However, if you have registered with MobiCom for fewer days, then that $145 rebate will be removed from your hotel reservation for those nights that you are not registered for the conference/workshops. Please be sure to use the same name in your MobiCom registration as your hotel reservation to avoid being overcharged. Note that the hotel reservation site shows you a total amount for the dates that you select and does not break down the cost on a per-night basis – you can refer back to this table above to understand what the rates are for each night.</b></p>

<p><b>These hotel rates include UNLIMITED, high-quality food and beverages at multiple restaurants inside the hotel and free room service.</b> This is a great deal for staying at a high end resort. You likely won’t find a cheaper option nearby. There may be some less expensive options in the cities of Cabo San Lucas or San Jose Del Cabo, but commuting between them and the conference venue will be difficult and expensive so <b>we highly recommend you stay at the conference venue.</b></p>

<h5><b>Views and Amenities</b></h5>
<p>The hotel rooms overlook Paradisus' private crescent cove beach in the beautiful Sea of Cortez, surrounded by sets of lush gardens and terraces. The private beach is swimmable. </p>
