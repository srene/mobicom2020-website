<h5><a name="roomrates"><b>Hotel Pricing</b></a></h5>
On days where at least one person in the room is registered for the main conference or a workshop, the hotel room rate at the <a href="venue.php">venue hotel</a> (The Paradisus) for the night before will include a $145 rebate from ACM.  We have also negotiated lower rates on other nights. Rooms include unlimited food, beverages, and access to the resort from 4pm on each day of your reservation to 4pm the following day. <br/><br/>

<p>* For example, for one adult in a Junior Suite, if you arrive on Saturday 10/19, depart on Friday 10/25 and attend a workshop on Monday, the main conference on Tuesday - Thursday, and a workshop on Friday, you will pay $336 for the night of 10/19 and $191 for the nights of 10/20, 10/21, 10/22, 10/23, and 10/24. These rates are available with early, late, and on-site registration on a first come, first served basis.</p>

<p><b>The hotel reservations link will give you the $145 rebate from ACM on all nights of Oct 20 through Oct 24. However, if you have registered with MobiCom for fewer days, then that $145 rebate will be removed from your hotel reservation for those nights that you are not registered for the conference/workshops. Please be sure to use the same name in your MobiCom registration as your hotel reservation to avoid being overcharged. Note that the hotel reservation site shows you a total amount for the dates that you select and does not break down the cost on a per-night basis – you can refer back to this table above to understand what the rates are for each night.</b></p>

<p>This is a great deal for staying at a high end resort. You likely won’t find a cheaper option nearby. There may be some less expensive options in the cities of Cabo San Lucas or San Jose Del Cabo, but commuting between them and the conference venue will be difficult and expensive so WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU STAY AT THE CONFERENCE VENUE.</p>

<h5><b>Terms and Conditions</b></h5>
All payments are processed through the Cvent - the MobiCom 2019 organization committee has no liability whatsoever. Member registration rates are available to members of SIGMOBILE or ACM only. Student registration rates are available to full-time students only (a valid student ID or other proof of full-time student status is required to pick up the registration on-site).<br/><br/>

<h5><b>Refund/Cancellation Policy</b></h5>
All registration refund requests must be sent via email to Yuanchao Shu (<a href="mailto:Yuanchao.Shu@microsoft.com">Yuanchao.Shu@microsoft.com</a>) and received no later than September 30, 2019. A full refund, less a $75 processing fee, will be issued. For those who pay by credit card, refunds can only be processed to the credit card to which the original charge was made. Processing of the refunds may take over 30 days. Refund requests received after September 30, 2019 will not be honored. No-shows are subject to the full fee.<br/><br/>

<h5><b>Payment Methods</b></h5>
Credit Card is the preferred/suggested method for registration. However, domestic and international wire transfers are accepted, details of which will be provided on registration. Residents of the following countries are invited to pay by wire transfer: Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria. Please clearly state your name and registration ID if you choose off-line payment options. The amount to be paid should be the US dollars we should receive + whatever processing fees that you may be charged. Unless we receive the full amount you owe MobiCom in US dollars, your registration status is not considered confirmed. Please contact Yuanchao Shu with any inquiries.
