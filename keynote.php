<b>Abstract:</b> One of the most important scientific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electronics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of pathologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions, however, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with the tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent advances in electronics have made available materials with a unique combination of attractive properties, including mechanical flexibility, mixed ionic/electronic conduction, enhanced biocompatibility, and capability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for recording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materials offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathologies.</p>

<b>Abstract:</b> Since cellular networks have been deployed, the radio access network (RAN) has been a vertically integrated and closed part of the network. This has limited network agility, increased cost, hindered innovation and has led to vendor consolidation. Over the past few years, for the first time ever, this has begun to change. We founded the xRAN forum out of our research on cellular network virtualization in 2016 which has now evolved to the O-RAN alliance that is defining the open RAN architecture. Open RAN has quickly become a movement that has been embraced both by cellular network operators and regulators as a means to diversify the cellular infrastructure supply chain and introduce much needed innovation. I will discuss the genesis of this architecture, initial successes with the deployment of the Rakuten and Dish networks in Japan and the US, and the road ahead.

<b>Abstract:</b> Mobile and embedded devices increasingly rely on deep neural networks to understand the world -- a formerly impossible feat that would have overwhelmed their system resources just a few years ago. The age of on-device artificial intelligence is now upon us; but incredibly, these dramatic changes are just the beginning. Looking ahead, mobile machine learning will extend beyond simply classifying categories and perceptual tasks, to performing roles that alter how every part of the systems stack of smart devices function. This next evolution in constrained-resource computing will finally produce devices that meet our expectations in how they can learn, reason and react to the real-world. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the initial breakthroughs that allowed us to reach this point, and outline a number of looming open problems we must overcome to bring about this next phase in the deep transformation of mobile and embedded computing.</p>

Nic has received multiple best paper awards, including ACM/IEEE IPSN 2017 and two from ACM UbiComp (2012 and 2015). In 2018 and 2019, he (and his co-authors) received the ACM SenSys Test-of-Time award and ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time award for pioneering research, performed during his PhD thesis, that devised machine learning algorithms used today on devices like smartphones.

<b>Abstract:</b> 5G networks are poised to become the unifying connectivity fabric – across spectrum, services and deployment models. Venues, enterprises, industrial operations, healthcare, and city infrastructure will all become smart connected spaces, big or small, and in public or private networking domains. Learn how network architectures will evolve to situate network functions where they most efficiently and securely cater to the unique requirements of each use case, and scale easily with demand. Join this keynote to get perspective on some of the exciting milestones along this 5G network evolution journey such as disaggregated network functions, open interfaces, virtualization, with the opportunistic use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) white boxes and inline accelerators, high performance radios, and lower latency with intelligence at the wireless edge.

<b>Abstract:</b> Preparing research for production—so-called technology transfer—is, beyond the lab, a fraught and often thankless exercise in organizational diplomacy, problem solving, and improvisation. After nearly a decade of bridging the research and product worlds at Google, I have many stories of tech transfer that highlight lessons I've learned—lessons I hope can help others transforming research into cutting-edge tech that ships quickly and at scale.</p>

<h5 align="center"><div id="ron"></div><b>Keynote 6: <a href='https://youtu.be/pFEa5mznCJs'>From Early NFV to NLP – a Network Operator’s R&D Journey</a></b></h5>
<h5 align="center"><b>Dr. Ron Marquardt</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Vice President of Advanced Technologies & Innovation, T-Mobile</h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Thursday, 24th September, 08:15-09:15 PDT</i></h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Session Chair: Karthik Sundaresan</i></h5>
<br/>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> While R&D investigations in industry may not often be viewed as “cutting edge” as similar efforts in academia, our work can benefit from being rooted in very concrete, practical challenges and yield an interesting and fruitful journey, nonetheless.  Using the experiences of the R&D team formerly at US mobile operator Sprint, and now part of T-Mobile USA, the progression of a research vein is followed from its earliest concept, through multiple partnerships and intermediate results, to show some surprising ways in which an industry’s challenges can be met through collaboration, and spawn unanticipated new R&D efforts along the way.  How does NLP relate to NFV?  Can open source development supplement and improve industry standards?  What benefits does a network operator find from such an exploration?  These issues and more will be touched upon as the evolution of one mobile operator’s commercial R&D project is explored.</p>
