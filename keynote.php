<b>Abstract:</b> One of the most important scientific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electronics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of pathologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions, however, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with the tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent advances in electronics have made available materials with a unique combination of attractive properties, including mechanical flexibility, mixed ionic/electronic conduction, enhanced biocompatibility, and capability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for recording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materials offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathologies.</p>

<h5 align="center"><div id="alex"></div><b>Keynote 5: From Research to Product: Stories from the Frontlines of R+D</b></h5>
<h5 align="center"><b>Alex Kauffmann</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Google</h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Wednesday, 23rd September, 10:20-11:20 PDT</i></h5>

<b>Abstract:</b> Preparing research for production—so-called technology transfer—is, beyond the lab, a fraught and often thankless exercise in organizational diplomacy, problem solving, and improvisation. After nearly a decade of bridging the research and product worlds at Google, I have many stories of tech transfer that highlight lessons I've learned—lessons I hope can help others transforming research into cutting-edge tech that ships quickly and at scale.</p>
