<h5 align="center"><b>George Malliaras</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge</h5>

<b>Abstract:</b> One of the most important scientific and technological frontiers of our time is the interfacing of electronics with the human brain. This endeavour promises to help understand how the brain works and deliver new tools for diagnosis and treatment of pathologies including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Current solutions, however, are limited by the materials that are brought in contact with the tissue and transduce signals across the biotic/abiotic interface. Recent advances in electronics have made available materials with a unique combination of attractive properties, including mechanical flexibility, mixed ionic/electronic conduction, enhanced biocompatibility, and capability for drug delivery. I will present examples of novel devices for recording and stimulation of neurons and show that organic electronic materials offer tremendous opportunities to study the brain and treat its pathologies.</p>

<h5 align="center"><div id="katti"></div><b>Keynote 2: Disaggregating the Cellular Radio Access Network with O-RAN</b></h5>
<h5 align="center"><b>Sachin Katti</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Stanford University and VMware</h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Monday, 21st September, 09:00-10:00 PDT</i></h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Session Chair: Joerg Widmer</i></h5>
<br/>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Since cellular networks have been deployed, the radio access network (RAN) has been a vertically integrated and closed part of the network. This has limited network agility, increased cost, hindered innovation and has led to vendor consolidation. Over the past few years, for the first time ever, this has begun to change. We founded the xRAN forum out of our research on cellular network virtualization in 2016 which has now evolved to the O-RAN alliance that is defining the open RAN architecture. Open RAN has quickly become a movement that has been embraced both by cellular network operators and regulators as a means to diversify the cellular infrastructure supply chain and introduce much needed innovation. I will discuss the genesis of this architecture, initial successes with the deployment of the Rakuten and Dish networks in Japan and the US, and the road ahead.

<h5 align="center"><div id="malladi"></div><b>Keynote 4: What's next in 5G infrastructure?</b></h5>
<h5 align="center"><b>Durga Malladi</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Qualcomm Technologies</h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Wednesday, 23rd September, 09:15-10:15 PDT</i></h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Session Chair: Bozidar Radunovic</i></h5>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> 5G networks are poised to become the unifying connectivity fabric – across spectrum, services and deployment models. Venues, enterprises, industrial operations, healthcare, and city infrastructure will all become smart connected spaces, big or small, and in public or private networking domains. Learn how network architectures will evolve to situate network functions where they most efficiently and securely cater to the unique requirements of each use case, and scale easily with demand. Join this keynote to get perspective on some of the exciting milestones along this 5G network evolution journey such as disaggregated network functions, open interfaces, virtualization, with the opportunistic use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) white boxes and inline accelerators, high performance radios, and lower latency with intelligence at the wireless edge.

<h5 align="center"><b>Alex Kauffmann</b></h5>
<h5 align="center">Google</h5>
<h5 align="center"><i>Wednesday, 23rd September, 10:20-11:20 PDT</i></h5>

<b>Abstract:</b> Preparing research for production—so-called technology transfer—is, beyond the lab, a fraught and often thankless exercise in organizational diplomacy, problem solving, and improvisation. After nearly a decade of bridging the research and product worlds at Google, I have many stories of tech transfer that highlight lessons I've learned—lessons I hope can help others transforming research into cutting-edge tech that ships quickly and at scale.</p>
